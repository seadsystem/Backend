## Using the Vagrant Environment ##
 * Vagrant uses the VirtualBox provider by default, so
   you will first need to install VirtualBox or find
   a suitable Vagrant extension for your virtualization
   platform
 * Download and install Vagrant from
   https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
 * From this directory, execute `vagrant up` to create
   the virtual machine, which will be provisioned
   after boot
 * See the Vagrant docs for more information on using the
   cli: https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html
