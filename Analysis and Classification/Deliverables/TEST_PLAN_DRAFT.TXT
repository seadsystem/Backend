1. Introduction



2. TEST PLAN
2.1 	FEATURES TO BE TESTED

	We plan to test the software on SEAD plug data files in .csv format only from only the following device types:
	* Microwaves
	* Laptop computers
	* Incandescent lamps that draw 40 or more watts
	The data files used to perform the testing should be gather from devices satisfyingly similar to the devices measured while building the classifier running under typical conditions. (i.e., no circa-1980s machines with CRT monitors, etc).

2.2 	FEATURES NOT TO BE TESTED

	* Detection and / or classification of unknown device types
	* Detection and / or classification of device types other than those listed above
	* Live functioning, e.g., working in step with the database and frontend.
	We reserve the right to add elements to this section as necessary that may not have been though of when the document was prepared.
