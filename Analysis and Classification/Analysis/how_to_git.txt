In bash...

I. Fork the repository
	1. Go to our backend repo. In the top left, click 'Fork'.
      Now you have your own fork of the repo.

II. Create a local clone of your fork
	1. Go to the directory that you want to keep your local working 
      fork in.
	2. Issue this command:
      git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Backend
		This downloads the repo to a folder named 'Backend' in your 
      current directory. 

III. Configure Git to sync your fork with the original directory
	1. cd into the repo.
	2. Check out the current remote repo by issuing this command:
		git remote -v
		This shows you where you're configured to fetch from and push to.
		To keep synced with the original repo, you need to add it by 
      issuing this command:
		git remote add upstream https://github.com/seadsystem/Backend.git
	3. Check that it worked by issuing git remote -v again.
