These devices fall into more than one group, and should not be used 
used in testing:
* TVs
* Speakers

These device types are represented by only tested unit, and should not
be used in testing IFF we get more data and it continues to exhibit 
distinct distributions: 
* Desktop Computer

I think it's feasible to say we can distinguish:
* Lamps from laptops
* Lamps from microwaves

The uncategorizable group contains a flatpanel monitor (expected) and 
a lamp (unexpected). This lamp is an incandescent halogen rated at 20W,
well half that of the other lamps. What's more, the other lamps 
produce more distinct spikes as power draw increases. 

Microwaves seem to have a distinct second spike, and start heading 
upward, whereas lamps have a less distinct second spike at a higher 
frequency, and start heading down. (i.e., df(t)/dt < 0)

What's more, microwaves have two spikes well above f = 0 that exceed 
the second standard deviation, while lamps have f(0) > 2*std, and do 
not exceed the second std elsewhere.

If these features hold, we may be able to distinguish lamps from 
microwaves. 

At the moment, I think it is reasonable to say that we should shoot 
for distinguishing between laptops and microwaves or lamps. All of the 
laptops we've studied...
* Have two peaks above the 5th std. 
* Probably have none above the 7th
... while all the microwaves and lamps have ...
* One peak above at least the 8th
* One peak above the 3rd (4th to be safe)

Differences between Lamps and Microwaves:
* Peak_value_microwave ~= 40 * peak_value_lamp
