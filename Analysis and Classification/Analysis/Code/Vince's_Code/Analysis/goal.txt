* Modified Analysis.py to read old-format plug csvs.

========================================================================
To do
========================================================================

* Get the script to read Ian's files
  1. Read the first line. If the first element is any of
     WTIV

* Construct the demo. 
* When called with only one argument and that argument is an option, 
  the program thinks the argument is a file. 
* Weird output happens when the program is called in an efficient way for many files. Truncated odd output below:
[Analysis] $ python Analysis.py -c all_in_one_folder/plots/Microwaves/*.csv 
Ignoring invalid option: '/'
Ignoring invalid option: '1'
Ignoring invalid option: '2'
Ignoring invalid option: '7'
Ignoring invalid option: 'K'
Ignoring invalid option: 'M'
Ignoring invalid option: 'Q'
Ignoring invalid option: 'W'


Goal for demo tomorrow:
* For the devices from the apparently-distinct categories, when passed a file from any of the devices, print to stdout the category name. 

To do:
1. Visually inspect the plots and decide on distinguishing features. 
   Features:
   * 

2. Add an option '-c' for classification. 

3. Make a routine that finds number
=======
1. Enable the code to use 'I' instead of device ID
   do this by adding to the regex?

2. Editing this file to test github addition tracking info.
