These files are intended to produce a time usage report for each 
fragmented data file. 

I wrote these pretty quickly, and decided to leave out file existence 
checking, or even asking the user what they'd like the output file to 
be named. The time_analysis.sh script will overwrite any results.txt 
in the directory, so be sure to take some manner of precaution in case 
you need to save previous results.
